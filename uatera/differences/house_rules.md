The following rules will be used in Emmia's campaigns in Uatera.

## Darkvision
As is written in the Player's Handbook, having Darkvision allows you to see in
the dark up to a certain distance. This is however considered dim light, and
attacking in the darkness still gives you disadvantage on your attacks.  

**Exception**: This does not apply to abilities like the Warlock invocation Devil's
Sight, which allows you to see normally in darkness as if it were bright light.

## Backgrounds
As is written in the Player's Handbook, you can customize your background. Each
background gives you the following:
* Any two skills of your choosing
* Any two languages or tool proficiencies (or a combination thereof)
* A background feature chosen from the list of available backgrounds
* An item kit from the list of available backgrounds

You may also work with me to customize your background feature and background
kit to your liking.
