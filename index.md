Hello! My name is Emmia Silk. This site is for me to store my notes for
*Dungeons and Dragons* and any other roleplaying games that interest me.

## Uatera
At the time of writing, my current project is a world known as [Uatera](/uatera/).
Uatera is an RPG setting of my own creation. It's something that has been
bouncing around in my head for years, and it's really exciting to get some of
it finally written down.
