Dryads, also known as Wood Nymphs, are a nymphic ancestry closely connected
with nature. They are the first of the Nymphs. Despite being one of the most
widespread ancestries in Uatera, they are rarely seen by outsiders, due to
their reclusive nature and small local populations.


## Appearance
Dryads are perhaps the embodiment of natural beauty. They prefer to wear the
foliage of their homelands on their bodies rather than fabric materials like
wool or cotton. When performing what little processing they do to these plants,
they are careful to protect the lives of the flora they wear. They decorate
their green, red, or brown hair with leaves and flowers. Their skin bears the
texture of finished wood, which protects them from the dangers of the
wilderness.


## History
The first Nymphs were created in the circle of Lemiota shortly before the
Perversion of Titans. It is said that they were crafted by the titan Lantana by
mixing the natural spirits with the flora of the world. When Lantana was slain,
his body became the Tree of Souls, where all Dryads souls go when they die.


## Society
The Dryads have spread throughout Uatera, forming Kinships all over. In Dryadic
society, a Kinship consists of a circle of druids who govern the lives of all
the Dryads in the area. The members of the Kinship are chosen through a secret
process unique to each kinship. All Kinship members are highly respected in
their communities for their skill, knowledge, wisdom, or some other reason.

Dryad children are made through a process where an ash sapling is planted in
a forest. This expands the forest and gives the child a connection to the Tree
of Souls. The success of the sapling is indicative of the success the child
will have in life, as the lives of the child and the sapling are closely
intertwined.

Those who commit terrible crimes against the forest are cursed to protect it
forever. Their lives are bonded to the tree of their birth, whereby if the tree
dies, the Dryad will also die. If the dryad abandons their post protecting the
tree, they will become weaker until they collapse on the earth and perish.


## Dryad Names
Like other Nymphs, Dryads have one name. A Dryad child's name is chosen by
their Kinship's elders at birth. Very few Dryads share the same name, as Dryad
caregivers like to choose unique names.

**Dryad Names**: Amphite, Aethisia, Adaise, Calidanea, Castalia, Crotheise,
Danais, Erato, Hegetoria, Limnorelia, Melanippe, Merope, Ornia, Pareia,
Panelophe, Pherolusei, Rhodys, Theanole, Thoniphe, Zeuxipia

## Dryad Traits
As a Dryad, you have the following traits.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Wisdom score increases by 2. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Age
Nymphs mature at the same rate humans do, but do not declare themselves to be
adults until around the age of 30. A Nymph is likely to die of age by the time
they reach 200.

#### Size
Nymphs are slightly shorter than humans, averaging about 5 and a half feet
tall. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Nymphic Magic
You know the Druidcraft cantrip. At 3rd level, you learn the Cure Wounds spell,
which you can cast once at 1st level and regain the ability to do so again when
you take a long rest. To cast Cure Wounds, you must kiss the target. Wisdom
is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Speak with Plant Life
Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with plants, and
although you have no special ability to understand unintelligent plants in
return, you may make an Insight check to tell how a plant is feeling.
You also have advantage on all Charisma checks to influence them.

#### Natural Armor
Your skin is thick and woody. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 +
your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if
the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply
as normal when you use your natural armor.

#### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Dryadic and Dwarven Imperial. The Dryadic
language is a dialect of Nymphic that should only be spoken in the forest or
around forest creatures.
