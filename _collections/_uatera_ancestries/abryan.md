and hair as white as snow, the Abryans are practically built to thrive in the
icy valley they come from. In a blizzard, an Abryan clothed in white would be
indistinguishable from the snow behind them if not for their eyes, which are
usually red or violet in color.


## Abryan Names
Abryans have a clan name and a personal name. In Abryan culture, people are
usually referred to by their clan name, except by close friends and members
