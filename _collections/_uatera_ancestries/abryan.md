## History
According to the engravings on the hall of history, the Abryans are said to
have been created by Arapoaz the Insightful. Living atop the Titan's back, the
Abryans enjoyed a long era of peace and prosperity. This all changed when
Arapoaz fell.

During the Perversion of Titans, the gods of the world went mad. Among these
maddened gods was Lula the Invulnerable Dragon, Arapoaz's only love. Lula
threatened to devour Arapoaz's realm, the Abryan valley. Arapoaz hid his
creations in a glacier, then fought with Lula in a battle that lasted three
days, culminating in the slaying of Lula. Heavily injured by the battle,
Arapoaz fell into a deep slumber under the glacier.

It has been six hundred years since Arapoaz began his rest, yet his following
remains strong.


## Appearance
Compared to other humans, Abryans are somewhat short and plump. With skin
and hair as white as snow, the Abryans are practically built to thrive in the
icy valley they come from. In a blizzard, an Abryan clothed in white would be
indistinguishable from the snow behind them if not for their eyes, which are
usually red or violet in color.


## Abryan Names
Abryans have a clan name and a personal name. In Abryan culture, people are
usually referred to by their clan name, except by close friends and members
of their clan.  

Personal names are only given after a child has proven their talents and begun
their first apprenticeship.
