The Asmani, also known as Imperials, were once the most powerful nation in the
great Dwarven empire. When their empire was reduced to ash by the three
warring titans, the Asmani sailed across the sea in search of refuge. Their
ambitious nature is sometimes offputting to other folk.


## Appearance
Asmani are a short, stocky folk. They stand anywhere between 4 and 5 feet tall,
and weigh between 130 and 180 lbs. Their skin, hair, and eyes are earthy
colors. Male Asmani tend to sport long, elegant beards. Some Asmani decorate
their beards with ornaments relating to their clans.


## History
The Asmani Imperial Dwarves were created in the faraway mountainous circle of
Asman. The mountains were filled with a bounty of minerals and treasure near
the surface, which the Asmani had easy access to. Digging up these gems and
metals taught the Dwarves to become skilled miners and diggers. Their society
became dependent on these resources, and when the Asman mountains ran out of
metals to forge and craft with, the Asmani Dwarves spread out into other
circles with the hopes that they could take the resources for themselves.

As the Asmani explored the other circles, they encountered various
civilizations of other races. Through diplomacy and conquest, they vassalized
or allied with many of the nations in their local cluster. Their empire
flourished over 700 years, and united many races under one banner.

The Dwarven Empire came to an end when three titans awoke from their slumber and
began a rampage across the Arasti cluster. The people of the Empire fled
across the sea into Uatera, where they took refuge in costal circles such as
Lula, Seahallow, and Palmany.


## Society
As a culture, the Asmani value ambition, patience, and teamwork. Growing up,
Asmani are expected to pursue lofty goals that are just beyond their reach.
In Asmani towns, children are taught that if they work together and are
persistent, they will achieve their goals. They are taught to support those who
face failure, and learn not to fear it.

They dig expansive underground fortresses where they live and craft. In places
where digging is difficult, they build tall keeps to keep out night beasts.
It is said that an Asmani Dwarf feels safest in a fortress of stone rather than
a house of wood.

Asmani towns and villages are typically led by a traditional council of
lords, in which positions of leadership can be elected, inherited, or chosen by
divine mandate depending on the wishes of the previous holder of the position.
Asmani nations are typically led by a council and a sovereign, which work
together to manage the political landscape of the nation. Not all Asmani
leaders are Dwarves, such as Queen Furia Damasus, the human soverign of
Goldencrest.


## Asmani Names
Asmani Dwarves have three names: A given name, a middle name, and a clan name.  
Middle names are usually chosen to honor a beloved ancestor. Some Asmani
Dwarves prefer to be referred to by their middle names. Clan names are
inherited from a parent, or when an Asmani marries into a clan they may take
their partner's clan name.
