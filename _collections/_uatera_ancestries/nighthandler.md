The Nighthandlers are an elusive form of night creature. Intelligent as people,
they are believed to lead other night beasts in their destructive rampages.
They possess magical power, the type of which can be discerned from the color
of the markings on their bodies. If you spot a Nighthandler, it is nearly
certain that there are more night beasts nearby.


## Appearance
Generally short by human standards, Nighthandlers average around 4 feet tall
and range anywhere between 3 and 6 feet in height. Their body is covered in
short, soft fur, which grows in two colors. Much of the fur on their
bodies is pale blue, green, red, or white, while the fur covering their limbs
tends to be black.

On the limbs of each Nighthandler, there is at least one word of power written
in brightly colored script. The color of this writing correlates with the type
of magic they are capable of using. Nighthandlers also have hair on the tops of
their heads of the same color, which grows longer as the Nighthandler's magical
power becomes greater.


## Nighthandler Magic
Every Nighthandler has a word of power written on their limbs. Their natural
arcane abilities allow them to invoke the word of power to produce magical
effects. No two Nighthandlers bear the same word of power. A Nighthandler's
mana is stored in the long, brightly-colored hair on their heads. It is
possible to prevent one from using magic by cutting off their hair.


## Life Cycle
Nighthandlers are created by Wrathmothers after they capture a living person.
The Wrathmother coats its victim in an ooze which hardens into a chrysalis. The
victim transforms into a night beast over the course of six months in their
incubation process. It is not known whether most Nighthandlers retain memories
of their previous lives, but a few specimens have been found to retain these
memories and some of their original motivations. While rare, this has been
known to occur on occasion in Nighthandlers that were removed from their
chrysalis before their incubation period is complete.

As soon as a Nighthandler breaks free from their chrysalis, they are forcefully
connected to the local Collective Mind. If there is no Mindcore nearby to
facilitate this process, it is impossible for the connection to be made.


## Nighthandler Adventurers
When a Nighthandler is disconnected from the Collective Mind, it loses many of
the destructive tendencies associated with Night Beasts. It gains a will of its
own, and can pursue its own goals.

There have been a few cases where independent Nighthandlers have attempted to
join civilization. It is from these independents that we have much of our
information on Nighthandler biology in the first place. Being night beasts,
Nighthandlers are feared and rarely accepted by civilization. Most prefer to
disguise themselves as members of another race to avoid persecution, or travel
with a band of trusted allies who can protect them if trouble comes their way.
