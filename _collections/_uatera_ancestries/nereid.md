Nereids are amphibious Nymphs found in Lula's Moonsea.

## Appearance
Nereids are humanlike in most regards. Nereid skin ranges in color from a pale
blue to a light peach to a dark brown. Their hair can be a variety of colors,
including silver, blue, red, and violet. Like other nymphs, the flora of the
place where they were born grows on their bodies. In particular, Nereids like
to grow seaweed and near-water flowers in their hair and on their clothing.


## History
Nereids were created by the titan Arashau in an ocean circle, which collapsed
three centuries ago in an unnatural tragedy. Without a circle to call their
own, the fractured Nereid kinships searched for a place to take refuge from the
night beasts that were appearing within Hana's ocean.

The kinships first tried asking for help from the Mer khaganate. Unfortunately,
the Merfolk did not take kindly to the Nymphs taking refuge in their home
circles. They were seen as invaders, and many Nereids were taken as slaves for
the khaganate's elite. Having no place within the Khaganate's caste system,
the Nereids fled to more earthly circles.

When the Nereids arrived at Lula, the leaders of the Kingdom of Goldencrest
took pity on their plight. The Kinships were given a home within Lula's
Midsea and became one of the founding signatories of the Goldencrest Alliance.


## Society
Nereids live in sunlit zones of the Midsea. Many reside near the shores,
where they bask in sunlight and trade with nearby towns. They don't build
structures of their own, preferring to reside within the kelp forests and
burrows dug into the sand. The Nereids do not have an army of their own.
Instead, they are protected by the armies of the Goldencrest Alliance.


## Nereid Names
Like other Nymphs, Nereids have one name. A nymph child's name is chosen by
their kinship elders at birth. Nymphic names act as a sort of prophecy to the
bearer, so a good name is chosen with the hope that the story it tells will
come to pass. Later in life, a Nereid may choose to change their name to
reflect a new destiny.

It is common for Nereids living on land to pick a name in the language of the
people they live with.
